# gradle-concourse-plugin
This plugin takes a project with Concourse plugins and packages them into a
bundle that can be installed with the `concourse plugins install <file>`
command.

In particular, this plugin packages a project into a common bundle structure
with the following structure:

[bundle-name]-[bundle-version]
    lib/
        [jars]
    bin/
        [scripts]
    conf/
        plugin.prefs
```
Bundles are produced as a zip file named `[bundle-name]-[project.version].zip`.
